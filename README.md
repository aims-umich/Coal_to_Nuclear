## üõ†Ô∏è Environment Installation

To set up the environment for this project, follow these steps:

```bash
# 1. Create a new conda environment with the .yml file
conda create  -f C2N_env_environment.yml

# 2. Activate the environment
conda activate C2N_env

# 3. Install Jupyter and Papermill for notebook execution
pip install jupyter papermill
```

## How to generate the results

The dataset has been acquired from: https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2352484724002993

- Step 1: The "Relevant Attribute Values" sheet of the "Complete_Coal_Plant_Analysis_umich.xlsx" dataset has been used for generating the dataset with unprocessed objective values "coaldata.xlsx". This dataset is located in the "Coal_to_Nuclear/Processing" directory. Run the data processing script with either serial and parallel processing script:

```bash
nohup python coal_single_parallel_run.py &
```

Or:

```bash
nohup python coal_single_parallel_run.py &
```

These scripts create the "recorder.txt" file by using the dataset.

- Step 2: The "Coal_to_Nuclear/Processing/PCA" subdirectory is used for creating the results with PCA dimensionality reduction method. 

```bash
nohup python coaltonuclear_PCA.py.py &
```

- Step 3: The "Coal_to_Nuclear/Processing/CCA" subdirectory is used for creating the results with CCA dimensionality reduction method. 

```bash
nohup python coaltonuclear_CCA.py.py &
```

- Step 4: The Jupyter notebook "post_processor.ipynb" in the "Coal_to_Nuclear/Postprocessing" directory is used for analyzing the data processing results in the "recorder.txt", for identifying the best CPP sites, and visualizing the results to create the figures presented in the paper.

```bash
nohup papermill create_diagonal_validation_plot.ipynb create_diagonal_validation_plot_out.ipynb &
```
